# Object_Detection_using_yolo
Object recognition is a general term to describe a collection of related computer vision tasks that involve identifying objects in digital photographs.

Image classification involves predicting the class of one object in an image. 
Object localization refers to identifying the location of one or more objects in an image and drawing abounding box around their extent. Object detection combines these two tasks and localizes and classifies one or more objects in an image.
There are Many Object Detection Models,some of them are:

1.R-CNN Family

2.Yolo family

R-CNN is popular untill yolo is discovered.
Yolo outran every model because of its fastness.
I used yolov5 in this Object detection
